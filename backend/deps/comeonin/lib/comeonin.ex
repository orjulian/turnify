defmodule Comeonin do
  @moduledoc """
  Comeonin is a password hashing library that aims to make the
  secure validation of passwords as straightforward as possible.

  It also provides extensive documentation to help developers keep
  their apps secure.

  Comeonin supports Argon2, Bcrypt and Pbkdf2 (sha512 and sha256).
  These are all supported as optional dependencies.

  ## Use

  Each module offers the following functions (the first two are new to version 4):

    * `:add_hash` - hash a password and return it in a map with the password set to nil
    * `:check_pass` - check a password by comparing it with the stored hash, which is in a map
    * `:hashpwsalt` - hash a password, using a randomly generated salt
    * `:checkpw` - check a password by comparing it with the stored hash
    * `:dummy_checkpw` - perform a dummy check to make user enumeration more difficult
    * `:report` - print out a report of the hashing algorithm, to help with configuration

  For a lower-level API, you could also use the hashing dependency directly,
  without installing Comeonin.

  ## Choosing an algorithm

  The algorithms Argon2, Bcrypt and Pbkdf2 are generally considered to
  be the strongest currently available password hashing functions.

  Argon2 is a lot newer, and this can be considered to be both an advantage
  and a disadvantage. On the one hand, Argon2 benefits from more recent
  research. On the other hand, Argon2 has not received the same amount
  of scrutiny that Bcrypt / Pbkdf2 has.

  ### Argon2

  Argon2 is the winner of the [Password Hashing Competition (PHC)](https://password-hashing.net).

  Argon2 is a memory-hard password hashing function which can be used to hash
  passwords for credential storage, key derivation, or other applications.

  Being memory-hard means that it is not only computationally expensive,
  but it also uses a lot of memory (which can be configured). This means
  that it is much more difficult to attack Argon2 hashes using GPUs or
  dedicated hardware.

  More information is available at the [Argon2 reference C implementation
  repository](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2)

  ### Bcrypt

  Bcrypt is a well-tested password-based key derivation function designed
  by Niels Provos and David Mazi√®res. Bcrypt is an adaptive function, which
  means that it can be configured to remain slow and resistant to brute-force
  attacks even as computational power increases.

  Bcrypt has no known vulnerabilities and has been widely tested for
  over 15 years. However, as it has a low memory use, it is susceptible
  to GPU cracking attacks.

  ### Pbkdf2

  Pbkdf2 is a well-tested password-based key derivation function
  that uses a password, a variable-length salt and an iteration
  count and applies a pseudorandom function to these to
  produce a key. Like Bcrypt, it can be configured to remain slow
  as computational power increases.

  Pbkdf2 has no known vulnerabilities and has been widely tested for
  over 15 years. However, like Bcrypt, as it has a low memory use,
  it is susceptible to GPU cracking attacks.

  The original implementation used SHA-1 as the pseudorandom function,
  but this version uses HMAC-SHA-512, the default, or HMAC-SHA-256.
